# 3D Game - MiniLibX

Cub3D is a challenging project centered around constructing a raycasting game engine entirely from scratch, utilizing the C programming language. The primary objective of this endeavor is to render a 3D world within a 2D map, simulating navigation through intricate mazes. Your task is to develop a robust game engine capable of rendering walls, sprites, and managing player movement within a basic 3D setting.
